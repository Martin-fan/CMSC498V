Overview
-----------
The goal of this class is to expose students to advanced programming
language ideas, including theory of programming languages, type
systems,  high-level programming abstractions, and program analyses.
We will develop these ideas in three parts.

1. First, we start with a brief introduction to lambda calculus a
compact but highly expressive programming language. Due to its
simplicity lambda-calculus has been used to encode prototype type
systems and program analysis.

2. Second, we spend most of the class studying Haskell, a general
purpose, functional programming language. Haskell directly implements
the ideas of lambda-calculus and provides a high-level programing
language that uses various novel programming techniques, like
strong-typing, absence of side-effect, laziness, and monadic
programming.

3. Third, we present basic concepts of formal verification via Liquid
Haskell, a refinement type checker for Haskell programs that extends
Haskell's types with logical predicates to allow for expressive user
specifications.

Prerequisites
--------------
No prerequisites are officially required for the class. 
Some familiarity with the concepts of functional programming would make 
the transition to the Haskell world easier.  


Grading
-------

**The grading is not yet finalized.**

- Clicker-Questions (10%). In class participation and responses on the clicker questions.
- Homeworks (60%). There will be 4-5 take-home, programming assignments. 
- Final or Project (30%). In class final or programming projects; to be decided.
