Overview
-----------
The goal of this class is to expose students to advanced programming
language ideas, including theory of programming languages, type
systems,  high-level programming abstractions, and program analyses.
We will develop these ideas in three parts.

1. First, we start with a brief introduction to lambda calculus a
compact but highly expressive programming language. Due to its
simplicity lambda-calculus has been used to encode prototype type
systems and program analysis.

2. Second, we spend most of the class studying Haskell, a general
purpose, functional programming language. Haskell directly implements
the ideas of lambda-calculus and provides a high-level programing
language that uses various novel programming techniques, like
strong-typing, absence of side-effect, laziness, and monadic
programming.

3. Third, we present basic concepts of formal verification via Liquid
Haskell, a refinement type checker for Haskell programs that extends
Haskell's types with logical predicates to allow for expressive user
specifications.

Prerequisites
--------------
No prerequisites are officially required for the class. 
Some familiarity with the concepts of functional programming would make 
the transition to the Haskell world easier.  


Grading
-------

- Questions (10%). In class participation and responses on questions.
- Homeworks (20%). There will be small, almost-weekly, take-home, programming assignments. 
- Tournaments (20%). Two or three tournaments on a strategy programming game (like tic-tac-toe).
- [Project](https://nikivazou.github.io/CMSC498V/projects.html) (30%).  Haskell implementation of a (semi-) realistic project. 
- Final (20%). In class final.
