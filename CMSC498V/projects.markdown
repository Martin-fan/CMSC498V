The Final Project
====================================================


The project will happen at the *second* half of the semester. 
The goal of the project is to give you some realistic experience of Haskell development and [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).
You are expected to work in pairs and spend at least *30 hours* in the project.
